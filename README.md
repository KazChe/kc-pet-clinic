# kc-pet-clinic
playing around spring pet client 

This repo was used to get spring pet clinic up and running from scratch and only using its UI styles and static resources.

In memory databases, and Dataloder approach was used.
Once there was working end-end in place. Things will be switched to real relational DBs, using Spring Data JPA.

Maybe add Spring Data Neo4j at some point
